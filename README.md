# RFCR-NL: Positive-Negative Receptive Field Reasoning for Omni-supervised 3D Segmentation (TPAMI 2023)
This is the official implementation of RFCR-NL (TPAMI 2023), which is the extension work of RFCR (CVPR 2021) and utilized negative learning for both fully supervised and weakly supervised point cloud segmentation. For technical details, please refer to:
